        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
          I&apos;m Logan Pinney â€” a world-builder, Unreal Engine mentor, and technical
          educator based in Calgary, Alberta. With a background in computer
          science, motion design, and clinical medicine, my path has been anything
          but typical.
        </p>
  
        <p className="text-gray-600">
          I&apos;ve worked as an Unreal Engine Authorized Instructor, mentored students
          around the world, helped shape curriculum at CG Spectrum and Coursera,
          and contracted with Epic Games. My work combines deep technical
          expertise with creative vision â€” whether building real-time experiences,
          animating environments, or developing intelligent systems.
        </p>
  
        <p className="text-gray-600">
          I now focus on creating high-impact educational content, developing games
          and technical tools, and helping clients bring their creative ideas to life
          through tech and storytelling.
